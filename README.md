## Installation

1. **Download and Install Rainmeter:**
   - If you haven't already, download and install [Rainmeter](https://www.rainmeter.net/).

2. **Download the Modern Volbrig Skin:**
   - Download the latest release of the Modern Volbrig skin from the [releases page](https://github.com/NSTechBytes/ModernVolBrig/releases/tag/ModernVolBrig).

3. **Extract the Skin Files:**
   - Extract the downloaded ZIP file into the `Documents\Rainmeter\Skins` directory. You should see a folder named `ModernVolbrig` within the `Skins` directory.

4. **Load the Skin:**
   - Open Rainmeter and right-click on the Rainmeter icon in the system tray.
   - Select `Skins` > `ModernVolbrig` > `Main` > `Main.ini` to load the skin.

## Configuration

### Switching Between White and Dark Modes

Modern Volbrig supports both white and dark themes. You can switch between these modes using the built-in toggle button.

- **To Switch Modes:**
  - Click the toggle button on the skin to switch between white and dark modes. This button is located in the top right corner of the skin and is labeled with an icon that resembles a sun/moon.

### Customizing the Skin

You can customize various aspects of the Modern Volbrig skin to fit your preferences.

1. **Adjusting Volume and Brightness:**
   - The volume and brightness controls can be configured through the skin's `ModernVolbrig.ini` file. To adjust the settings, open the file in a text editor and modify the relevant sections.

2. **Changing Colors and Transparency:**
   - The skin uses semi-transparent backgrounds to achieve the frosted glass effect. You can adjust the transparency and color settings by modifying the `Color` and `Alpha` parameters in the `Main.ini` file.

3. **Adding Custom Icons:**
   - You can replace the default icons used for volume and brightness controls by placing your own images in the skin's folder and updating the `ImageName` parameters in the `ModernVolbrig.ini` file.

## Troubleshooting

- **Volume or Brightness Controls Not Working:**
  - Ensure that you have the necessary plugins or external scripts installed for controlling volume and brightness. Rainmeter alone may not handle these functions without additional support.

- **Skin Not Appearing:**
  - Verify that the skin files are located in the correct directory (`Documents\Rainmeter\Skins\ModernVolbrig`) and that Rainmeter is properly installed and running.

- **Issues with White and Dark Modes:**
  - If the mode toggle button is not functioning correctly, check the `ModernVolbrig.ini` file for any errors in the configuration. Make sure that the `LeftMouseUpAction` is correctly set to switch between themes.
